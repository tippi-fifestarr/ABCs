# ABCs
Develop phase (with readme abstract)

## begin with the end in mind
vision: unequivically demonstrate effective and efficient tippi fifestarr
is a five star instructional designer through a rapid iterative prototype
for Tony the Tutor, who tutored me in AP Physics back in 9th grade, and is
now failing to progress in the web development domain and its my honor to 
pay it forward.

## steps: backwards abcs
using rapid prototypes stemming from the original goal (prove to KT that i'm worth
interviewing for Instructional Designer at Chainlink by teaching Tony the Tutor who
is an Adult Learner with limited time and attention span for boring or useless things
but trying and failing to learn Web Development during the American Pandemic, in chunks:
0 step
1 by 
2 step
how to build a website (ABCs of Blockchain) that's inherently useful for learning 
something someone wants to teach, in this case, me eventually teaching him and many
others the way of the blockchain, and him, later onces he's gotten the hang of it, easily
adapting this page for his own Tutoring or personal interests)

# learning outcomes:
myself: do i have what it takes to swoop into the Instructional Designer at
Chainlink?
chainlink: tippi fifestarr has what it takes to translate expert domains into
something for everybody, plain and simple.
Tony the Tutor: how to build a website that might be useful for his own instructional
needs, which is at least two birds for the one project (he also is interested in learning
web development, but struggles through most online courses)
blockchain people: the gold star release of the ABCs of Blockchain is on-chain, open, 
decentralized, and tokenized for fun, easy access control, governance, and rewording 
contributions. Each "word" can be an NFT of its own.

# design:
sticky navbar at top, with 0-9 a-z hyperlinks to heading id tags #Z
simple html and one or two css steps to make it mobile first
useful for teaching blockchain to anyone with a smart phone
and extra rewards if you have a metamask wallet.

# example: #Z
<h2 id="Z">Z:</h2>
<div class="word">
z is for "zero knowledge proof": this "ZKP" NFT serves as a ticket to the "Ali Baba's Cave
(tippi's storytime) experience." It can be easily be modified for the B release to have 
VRF Randomness courtesy of chainlink, later.

## actual steps:
0. readme complete
1. in VS Code (or Sublime code editor), 
"create a new index.html file" in /abcs/ folder
2. in VS Code type "html5" and then press Tab on keyboard
to autogenerate from scratch a solid start for html page.
3. in the html document, look over its "head" and find the "title":
make it something like "ABCs of ___________", for this one, blockchain!
4. celebrate!
5. search engine "simple html5 sticky navbar" (try top non ad link for ~1-3 minutes, press back delete and repeat until done if necessary)
6. https://peterlunch.com/creating-a-simple-sticky-navbar-with-css-and-html/
7. pretty inspirational https://github.com/pin0S/portfolio
8. search engine "why isnt my css loading" if necessary ;)
9. get a rough and fast working prototype, hit a glitch.  push to github.

## evaluation: 
after hitting glitch, go with it. its a solid start and not intimidating ;)
try to solve the obvious problem for REP / wingbird points.
